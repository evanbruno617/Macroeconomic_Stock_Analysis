For my part of the project, I was in charge of creating our database, our tableau presentation, and integrating the tableau into our visualization portion of our website. As a team, we overcame having to re-start a completely different data set that changed our entire project in the second week. Having finished a database and a machine learning model in the first segment of our project, it was difficult coming to the decision we did to change our project, but after finishing our project, we (as a team) made the correct decision in the end. Focusing on macro economic factors along with stock ticker prices, we were able to visualize the data, drive the data into our machine learning model that came was approximately ~60% accuracy in predicting price based off the economic factors we threw into the model, and present the data on our website. I want to thank the team that I worked with. Everyone was great to work with and very involved in the process of creating our project.
