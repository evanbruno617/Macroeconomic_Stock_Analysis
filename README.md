# Introduction
I plan on predicting future gains on certain sectors of the stock market by analyzing various different stocks using a [Machine Learning Model](MachineLearning.ipynb), specifically a RandomForestClassifier model. This data was obtained using an API key from TD Ameritrade,[extract price history](extract_price_history.ipynb), and extracted it in intervals of months from 2002 to present day. The macro economic factors were obtained by extracting the data from various websites as csv and xlsx, [Raw Data](RawData). Following extracting the data, it was [cleaned](raw_data.ipynb) to needed format.
