# Macroeconomic Stock Analysis

## Background
Using stock price data to predict future stock prices as well as examining how macroeconomic factors will affect future stock prices as well (primarily focusing on inflationary data afflicting stock movement).

Due to the volatility in the current market, being able to predict how the stock market will react in the upcoming months could help us significantly with our financial decisions.
